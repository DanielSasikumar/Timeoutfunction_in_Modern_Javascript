#### Timeout function


This code demonstrates how to use the **`setTimeout`** function in modern JavaScript to create a simple countdown timer. It sequentially updates the content of an HTML element (`#result`) from 3 to 1, and finally displays **"Happy New Year!!!!!"**, with a 1-second delay between each update. This example illustrates **callback nesting**, sometimes referred to as "callback hell," which can occur when multiple asynchronous operations are chained together using nested `setTimeout` calls.
